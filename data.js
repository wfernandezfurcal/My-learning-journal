    preview: "After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.",
    howStayParagraph1: "Discipline and consistency have always been a challenge for me. I used to get excited about learning but would quickly lose focus or skip days. What changed things for me was building real projects as I learned. Even if it was something small, applying the concepts helped things stick.",
    howStayParagraph2: "I also realized that documenting my journey — through journaling or blog posts like this one — helped me stay accountable and track how far I’ve come. It keeps me motivated on the tough days, and it reminds me that progress is still progress, even if it’s slow.",
    howStartedParagraph1: "I began by taking notes while watching Scrimba lessons, and then writing quick summaries of what I learned in my own words. Later, I started creating simple web pages and experimenting with designs.",
    howStartedParagraph2: "That habit of reflecting, writing, and building helped me truly understand what I was learning — and it’s the reason I decided to start this learning journal. It’s not just a way to track my growth, but also to share what I learn with others who might be on a similar path."
